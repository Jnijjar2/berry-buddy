## About BerryBuddy
BerryBuddy is a ..... app

## Background
California’s wilderness is home to a diverse range of berries. There are too many berries for new foragers to reliably be able to identify which poses the risk of consuming poisonous or toxic varieties. This is especially dangerous since some of the toxic berries look and grow in the same places as commonly eaten berries. For instance, the Aralia Spinosa berry and American Elderberry are both bunched blackberries that grow out of red branches. Therefore, foragers need a tool that can help them distinguish between edible berries and potentially fatal ones, as well as a way to mark which berry bushes grow fruits that are safe to consume.

## Proposed Solution
BerryBuddy will utilize machine learning libraries in Python to train a neural net to identify and differentiate between the various berries endemic to California. Our program should then be able to identify berries in user-provided images, and relay relevant information. BerryBuddy will additionally be able to extract geolocation data from a user’s image and map the berries’ location on a map for future reference; diminishing the need for users to continuously take images of the same berry bush. If that data is not available, the user will also have the option to manually input that information, and add their own markers. Our program will also serve as a reference book, and will contain a catalog of all the berries commonly found in California, highlighting their identifying features.
